## Overview

This randomized controlled trial tests whether tailoring health behavior interventions to personality characteristics improves their effectiveness. We recruited 200 sedentary adults and assigned them to either a personality-matched intervention, a generic intervention, or a waitlist control group.

## Intervention Components

### Personality-Matched Condition
Participants received personalized feedback and strategies based on their Big Five personality profile:
- **High Conscientiousness**: Structured goal-setting and scheduling tools
- **High Extraversion**: Group exercise opportunities and social support
- **High Openness**: Variety in exercise types and novel activities
- **High Neuroticism**: Stress management and self-compassion exercises
- **High Agreeableness**: Partner accountability and community motivation

### Generic Condition
Standard physical activity recommendations and general motivation strategies.

## Measures

- **Primary outcome**: Physical activity (accelerometer data)
- **Secondary outcomes**: Self-reported exercise, motivation, self-efficacy
- **Follow-up**: 3, 6, and 12 months post-intervention

## Current Status

We completed data collection in Fall 2023 and are currently analyzing results. Preliminary analyses suggest that personality-matching improves adherence and outcomes, particularly for individuals high in neuroticism.

## Implications

If successful, this intervention approach could be implemented in clinical and community settings to improve health behavior change outcomes by accounting for individual differences in personality.

## Funding

Supported by a seed grant from the University Research Council.
