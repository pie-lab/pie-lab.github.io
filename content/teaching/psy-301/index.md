## Course Description

A course focused on developing critical thinking skills for evaluating psychological research. Students learn to read empirical articles, assess research validity, and understand the scientific method as applied to psychology. This course prepares students for upper-division psychology courses and research experiences.

## My Responsibilities as a GE

- Held weekly office hours to support students with coursework
- Assisted students in understanding and critiquing research articles
- Helped clarify concepts related to research design and validity
- Provided feedback on assignments and supported the grading process
- Answered student questions about research methods and interpretation

## Course Assessment Components

I supported students across multiple assignment types:

- **InQuizitive assignments** (40%): Weekly adaptive quizzes on research concepts
- **Article worksheet** (20%): Guided analysis of an empirical research article
- **Validity review** (20%): Critical evaluation of research design and validity
- **In-class assignments** (20%): Active learning exercises during class time

## Skills Developed

This experience deepened my ability to teach research methodology to students with varying levels of statistical and scientific background. I became more effective at helping students transition from passive consumers of research to critical evaluators of scientific claims.
