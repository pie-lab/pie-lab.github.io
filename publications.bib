	abstract = {This longitudinal study examined how personality traits predict health behavior change over a 12-month period. Using data from 450 adults, we found that conscientiousness and emotional stability significantly predicted adoption of regular exercise routines, while openness to experience facilitated dietary changes. These findings suggest that personality-tailored interventions may improve health behavior change outcomes.},
